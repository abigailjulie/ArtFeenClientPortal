## Overview

The ArchWay is a full-stack web application built to streamline the entire lifecycle of construction and architectural projects‚Äîfrom Predevelopment to Close-out. Designed for architectural firms, the platform centralizes project tracking, dynamic budgeting, role-based access, and AI-powered client communication.

üîß Replaces fragmented spreadsheets and disjointed communication with a secure, scalable platform built specifically for the architecture and construction industry.

### Key Metrics & Impact

- 80% reduction in manual administrative work via AI-powered onboarding workflows

- 95%+ delivery success rate for automated client and admin notifications

- 40% improvement in frontend performance through normalized state and render optimization

- 99% system reliability with persistent sessions, error boundaries, and graceful degradation

- 60% fewer redundant API calls using RTK Query with cache invalidation and optimistic updates

### Tech Stack

- Frontend
  - React, Redux Toolkit, RTK Query, React Router
- Backend
  - Node.js, Express
- Database
  - MongoDB

## My process

### Try it Locally

# Clone the repo

git clone https://github.com/your-username/archway-project.git
cd archway-project

# Install dependencies

npm install

# Set up .env file with MongoDB URI, JWT secret, etc.

# Start the app

npm run dev

### What I learned

I deepened my understanding of optimizing data fetching, security, and role-based access control in a full-stack environment. I focused on tailoring the user experience based on role, while clearly visualizing the three key pillars of architectural project management: budget, timeline, and project phase. I also integrated AI-powered workflows to reduce unnecessary communication and improve operational efficiency.

### Continued development

I plan to integrate TensorFlow to provide a visual ‚Äúhealth status‚Äù badge for each project: On Track, At Risk, or Behind. This will be determined using real-time data from phasePercentage, timelinePercent, and budgetUsePercent. This enhancement will provide users with immediate insight into project performance and support more informed decision-making.
